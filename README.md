# Campaign Analyzer PoC

**Goal**: Automate the analysis of marketing campaign reports by extracting performance metrics from PDFs/images, retrieving relevant brand guidelines, and generating actionable insights using LLMs.

### The Problem It Solves

Marketing teams receive campaign reports in PDF or image formats that are time-consuming to manually review. Brand guidelines exist but are rarely consulted during quick assessments. This PoC demonstrates an automated pipeline that combines OCR, retrieval-augmented generation, and LLM reasoning to provide consistent, data-driven campaign analysis in seconds.

## The Pipeline

### Phase 1: OCR & Extraction

The extraction pipeline uses a **hybrid approach** to handle both digitally-created PDFs and scanned documents or images.

- **For PDFs**: The pipeline first attempts direct text extraction using [`PyPDF2`](backend/extraction/ocr.py:12). If the extracted text is empty or very short (< 50 characters), it falls back to **OCR on the first page** using [`pdf2image`](backend/extraction/ocr.py:12) + [`pytesseract`](backend/extraction/ocr.py:12) (Tesseract).
- **For Images**: PNG, JPG, and JPEG files are processed directly with [`pytesseract.image_to_string()`](backend/extraction/ocr.py:12).

This ensures that both selectable-text PDFs and image-based reports are handled without relying on cloud vision APIs.

**Extracted Metrics**: Spend, ROAS, CTR, Impressions.

### Phase 2: Contextual Logic (RAG)

The RAG pipeline grounds the LLM's analysis in the brand guidelines provided.

1. **Chunking**: Guidelines are split into semantic chunks by paragraph (double newlines) via [`backend/rag/chunker.py`](backend/rag/chunker.py:4). This preserves context within each section while keeping chunks small enough for embedding.
2. **Embedding**: All chunks are embedded using [`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](backend/rag/embedder.py:20), a lightweight but high-quality model that produces 384-dimensional dense vectors. The model is loaded once and cached to avoid reloading on every call.
3. **Indexing & Retrieval**: Instead of a persistent vector database, the system uses an **in-memory FAISS index** built via LangChain's `FAISS` class. The index is ephemeral—created at runtime for each request and discarded after. A synthetic query is built from the extracted metrics, and the top-4 most similar chunks are retrieved using cosine similarity in [`backend/rag/retriever.py`](backend/rag/retriever.py:8).

### Phase 3: Agentic Reasoning

The analysis pipeline uses the [`NanoGPTClient`](backend/analysis/llm_client.py:19) class to call an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (NanoGPT).

The prompt injects:
1. The retrieved brand guideline context.
2. The parsed campaign metrics.

The LLM is instructed to respond **only in JSON** with exactly four keys:
- `comparison`: Metric-by-metric comparison against targets (Above / On Track / Below).
- `red_flag`: Exactly ONE identified issue with specific numbers and channels.
- `opportunity`: Exactly ONE improvement or scaling opportunity.
- `summary`: A bold, professional 3-sentence summary for a Client Lead.

This is intentionally **not** a multi-step agent loop. The design is one prompt → one response → structured result, making it fast, deterministic, and easy to debug.

## Design Philosophy

**Simple, not over-engineered.**

This project deliberately avoids complex patterns. Every architectural decision prioritizes simplicity:

- **No multi-step agent loops**: One prompt, one response; deterministic and fast.
- **No persistent vector databases**: Guidelines are chunked, embedded, and indexed at runtime using in-memory FAISS. This avoids infrastructure overhead, cost, and vendor lock-in for a PoC scope.
- **No cloud vision APIs**: The OCR stack (`PyPDF2`, `pdf2image`, `Tesseract`) is 100% local and open-source, eliminating per-page costs and network dependencies.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Core functionality relies on well-maintained open-source libraries.

The goal is a **proof-of-concept that demonstrates core competency**—the integration of OCR, RAG, and LLM reasoning—without over-engineering for production scale.

## How to Use

1. Start the application (see the setup instructions in your environment).
2. Upload a **campaign report** (PDF or image) and a **brand guidelines** text file via the web interface.
3. The pipeline will automatically extract metrics, retrieve relevant guideline context, and generate a structured analysis.
4. View the results—comparison, red flag, opportunity, and summary—directly in the UI.

---

## Sample Data

Sample test data is provided in the [`data/`](data/) folder for quick testing:

- [`aurora_q1_report.pdf`](data/aurora_q1_report.pdf) — a sample campaign report
- [`aurora_guidelines.txt`](data/aurora_guidelines.txt) — sample brand guidelines

Use these files to verify the pipeline end-to-end without preparing your own data.
